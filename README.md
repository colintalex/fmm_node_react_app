## Find My Market - Web App

#### Node.js/Express using MongoDB as a backend pointing to a ReactJS client-side app.
A recreation of final project at Turing School, Find My Market, in new languages with hopes of making even faster queries. 

##### What It's About 
The ultimate goal of this web app to provide a one-stop shop for anyone looking for Farmers Markets in their area. Additionally, registered users can favorite a market to be saved for later reference. A zoom-to feature allows the registered user to quickly locate any favorites, while clicking on any market on the map provides a list categories that are available for purchage. All data is sourced from the USDA API and cleaned for quicker, more reliable results. 

##### Why I Did It
The FindMymarket model has been super enjoyable since first conceived for the school project. The concept of the application just makes sense, and it's possiblities are vast. Also, the datasets are large and the importance of efficiency is at a higher threshold. **Perfect** for practice.
